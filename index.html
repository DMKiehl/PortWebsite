                    A current student at DevCodeCamp in Milwaukee, WI who enters the field with a B.S in Information Technology and a unique and varied background. Upon graduation in July, I will hold a Certificate of Completion from a 12-week immersive bootcamp in Software Development.

                    I entered the camp with over 15 years of retail, customer service, and management experience, as well as 8 years of wildlife research.
                    Over the years, I have worked on a variety of teams from field research teams studying two endangered species and long term migratory bird studies to building and maintaining an online store. I developed a critical thinking skills and a strong attention for detail 
                    through my work collecting data in the field as well as the resilience to push through the hard parts. Let me tell you walking on a sandbar in the blazing sun carrying a spotting scope while trying to find a nest in the sand with 4 little sand colored eggs can take a lot of patience!

                    <br>
                    I completed my degree in 2019 and through this bootcamp I have gained important hand-ons training in some of the most in-demand technologies. 
                    Through the bootcamp, I improved my critical thinking skills, gained experience understanding and developing user stories and UML diagrams, and worked on a team to develop a number of projects.
                    Most importantly, I have completed many projects either individually or as a member of a group. These projects highlight all the skills I developed throughout the program.
                    <br>
                    Many of my projects are available in the Portfolio section. I encourage you to check them out.
