                        Used the concepts of OOP to create classes and objects to interact with each other, I created a console application that has robots and dinosaurs fight in a battle.
                        While completing this project, I gained experience with classes, objects, and lists.

                        In this project, I created a basic Lemonade Stand game. Throughout the project, I gained experience with 
                        generating random numbers, understanding interfaces, SOLID principles, inheritance, and a deeper understanding of how objects and classes interact.

                        For this projet, I created a custom list class, modeled after the built in list class in C# without using any of the built-in List or Array methods. While developing this project, I gained experience in Test Driven Development
                        including creating unit test methods, deepened my knowledge of properties, Arrays, operator overloads, and how the generic List method in C# works. 
                        Methods include Adding and removing items from a list, converting the contents of a list to a string, overloading the + and - operator and zipping two lists.

                    <img class="Sweepstakes" src = "Images/Sweepstakes.png">
                    I created an application that provides the functionality to manage multiple sweepstakes. I implemented the logic for the functions and pieces of functionality that were requested
                    with the ability for the users to choose how they would like. I utilized the Dictionary, Queue, and Stack data structure as well created an interface (ISweepstakesManager) that had two classes inherit and implement its methods.
                    I gained experience using the dependency injection as well as the factory design pattern.

                    On a team of two, I contributed to the backend of an application for a humane society that stores and displays data about animals in a database. We were provided with started queries to set of the tables of the databse
                    and much of the code for the project. We were responsible for creating queries to add data to the database. For the program, we were responsible for creating functionality for a list of methods in the Query class that performed 
                    the CRUD operations that connect the database to the program. Coming into the project with much of the code provided created a unique learning experience that required us to step through the prorgram to determine its functionality and detemine how the 
                    methods we were going to be writing were being used. Throughout the project, I gained experience using Lambda expressions, LINQ query operators, SQL queries, and working on a team to meet one goal.
